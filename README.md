# Twitter-Analysis-The-European-Super-League

Social Media Analytics Project

For this assignment, imagine yourself in the role of an analyst who was recently hired by a business intelligence firm (or by an internal analytics group of an investment group). You will perform an analytics task and provide a report outlining the approach you have taken.

For this specific task, you should choose only ONE of the following categories:

Facebook page activity tracking.
Twitter message analytics.
Github trends mining.
Once you have chosen a category, select a business intelligence objective within that category along the lines of what has been done in class. However, please make sure that your analysis differs from the specific task you have done as a part of the group (e.g. different company/brand, different area of trends mining etc.). We are letting you be creative with the task and pursue your interests relying on the skills you have learned in class.

Please perform your analysis using Python programming language, in line with the rest of the classwork.

In completing this assignment, please submit a single pdf file that contains the following:

A brief overview of the task objective you have chosen.
A description of the tools you have developed, including the information about the API/dataset you have used.
Your main results in relation to the task objective you have chosen, with a summary of business implications of your findings.
A complete listing of your Python source code as an appendix (if you are comfortable using Github, please include a repository link instead).
Your grade for this assignment will be based on the quality of your analytics results as well as the completeness of your report.
